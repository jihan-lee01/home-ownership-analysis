    "The topic of homeownership holds immense significance in the context of the United States, reflecting not only economic stability but also broader societal patterns. In recent years, the dynamics of homeownership have evolved, influenced by  demographic, economic, and social factors have changed. This project investigates the determinants of homeownership rates within the United States. According to Illinois Wesleyan University, the impact of home-ownership determinants has fluctuated with the economy: “Marital status remains important to the homeownership decision, though its effect has weakened. The impact of the level of education is now just as important as the presence of children in a household” (IWU,1999). According to Brookings analyst Jenny Schuetz, discrimination in housing has contributed to substantial wealth gaps between Black and white households. Black and Latino or Hispanic families are less likely to own their homes than white families with similar incomes."

    "\n",
    "*Sex:* We think sex is a relevant variable to employ in our dataset as we believe men are more likely to own a house due to the gender wage gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Race:* Based on our research, ethnicity and race play a factor in home-ownership due to discrimination in the home-buying process and the general wealth gap between people of color and white individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Employment Status:* Employment status affects income and credit status, as well as the turnover rate for mortgage and ownership applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Education Level:* Education affects job attainment as well as future income. Education is also an indicator of background, where those who come from higher economic backgrounds are more likely to attend school or come from wealth, and therefore, more likely to own a home.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Citizenship Status:* Non-citizens may encounter difficulties accessing mortgage loans, face varied down payment requirements, and confront challenges in building a credit history. Additionally, their income and employment opportunities may impact their ability to afford a home, and some government programs may not be accessible to non-citizens. Fear of deportation among undocumented immigrants can also discourage home ownership.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Marital Status:* Based on our preliminary research, we observed that the highest share of home buyers in the United States in 2022 amongst all age groups was married couples. We believe this can be attributed to a higher income stability and combined incomes between the couple.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Income:* We believe that income holds a significant role in determining the household status of a person. The higher the income, the larger one’s disposable income, given those who earn a higher wage are more likely to be able to afford a home.  \n",

    "*Number of Family Members in Household:* We presume that the number of family members in a household will affect one’s household status. Given higher income stability of those who are married with children, we believe they are more likely to own a home.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disability:* Whether a person is disabled or not significantly determines the likelihood they own a home. From preliminary research, we noted that the lack of accessible and affordable housing is one of the largest obstacles people with disabilities face in obtaining housing. Given this, we presume that people with disabilities are less likely to own homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Veteran Status:* Veteran Status is a pertinent variable in our dataset given the discrepancies between veterans and non-veterans in economic status. In our preliminary research, we observed that roughly ⅕ of the homeless population consists of veterans, which leads us to the belief that veterans are less likely to own homes than non-veterans.\n"
